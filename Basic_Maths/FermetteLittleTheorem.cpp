// A,B -> Numbers
// m -> Prime Number

// (A/B)%m !=((A%m)/(B%m)) - equation 1

// we have to convert it to multiplication because

// (A*B)%m == (A%m*B%m)%m

// so in equation 1 we have to bring B in numberator -> we have to do B power -1

// B^-1 == (B^(m-2))%m   

//  if m not prime we have to use Euler’s Theorem -> phi -> euler totient function ✅ not improtant for placement
