Find nCr = n!/(n-r)!(r)!

we precompute factorial ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ

it not valid if -> 

what if factorial goes very large and we have to do modulo but ->

(a/b)%m != ((a%m)/(b%m))%m  âœ…  -> we cant say that

(a/b) =>
(b inverse = pow(b,-1)) 
Now -> 
 ((a%m)*(b inverse)%m)%m we can find âœ…

 if m is odd generally ->
 
 
 b inverse  = pow(b,m-2)%m   


simple hai always remember that line âœ…
